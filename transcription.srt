1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,560
So, huge apologies, especially to Rachel, who wasn't at the class. I forgot to record

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:19,120
Rachel. That shows how much I need you, that you're the one who reminds me. Huge apologies

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:24,640
about that. So, what I'm planning to do is just go through what we did. I hope it's all

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:32,240
okay and makes some sense along with the PDF. So, we talked through what we revised the strategy,

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:38,880
the steps that we did before for introducing Dottie Crutchett quaver, that the repertoire

6
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,240
is kind of crucial to everything we do. And when we're choosing that repertoire, it should have

7
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:50,640
only the known elements, the known rhythmic elements, plus the one new element, not two

8
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:58,000
new elements, only one. Then kinesthetically prepare the feeling for this concept here

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,720
in a game with at least one of the songs. Then we asked children slightly different questions.

10
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,280
Is there a new rhythm? Because it spans over two, there's a slightly different thing

11
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,760
going on here. And then we compared it with the ostinato. So, for example, we kept the

12
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:26,720
ostinato pattern going. It was ta-ti-ti-ta-ti-ti. And we used the song Nima Naya. Apologies,

13
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:34,960
the ostinato is ti-ti-ti-ti-ta-ta. And the children had to keep that ostinato going while

14
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:45,120
singing the song. Nima Naya. And discover where it matched, where what they sang matched,

15
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:52,720
or the other way to word the question, how long did the first pitch last? Nima.

16
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,600
And they can work out that it was three Ts, which is equivalent to three Ts tied. And then

17
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:06,800
we talked them through the dot, that two Ts tied is a ta, and the dot takes place of the third

18
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:15,200
Ti. Then we visually represented it. So, what we did in Breakout Rooms was look at similar steps

19
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:32,160
for Timka, using the song Molere Tanzen. And similarly, we kept an ostinato that was ti-ti-ka

20
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:41,520
with the kan-du. We could, of course, use an ostinato that's ti-ka-ti-ka, kan-du, to achieve

21
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:48,240
the same effect. But creating the ostinato is the important thing. So we did that in Breakout Rooms.

22
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:56,320
And then we spent the rest of the lesson looking at further repertoire for Compound Time,

23
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:01,040
for the practice of Compound Time. This is one of the final song, I think,

24
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:08,560
that we needed to analyse. So we analysed this one in class with the following tone set here.

25
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:18,560
Diatonic, literally, basically diatonic without the use of la. So start learning all of those

26
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:27,440
as we go, because we decided, I think, that the repertoire materials test would be after Christmas,

27
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,520
just to let us all get Christmas out of the way. And then we watched a little Maori stick passing

28
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:39,520
game. And of course, the song prepares this new rhythm here. But we talked about the fact that

29
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:45,200
this isn't really a new rhythm at all. They know ti-ka-ti-ka. It's something they know,

30
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:52,080
but in a different context. And I think when we get to A, this age, and B, this stage,

31
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,400
we don't need to go through every new rhythm in such detail. This is rhythms they know,

32
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,760
just grouped differently. The Compound Time is the new thing. So we watched this little

33
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:21,840
video here. I'm just going to play it in case you can't find it. I'll just play it for the recording.

34
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,040
We have been here sharing our culture with the world since 1963, when our buildings

35
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,280
and carvings were handcrafted in New Zealand and shipped over here piece by piece. And it

36
00:04:45,280 --> 00:05:05,280
is our pleasure now to share with you a small part of our culture.

37
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:35,280
Down together four, down together five, down together six, down together seven, stop.

38
00:05:45,280 --> 00:06:05,280
Thank you for playing the Tititoria. Hope to see you again soon.

39
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,280
Fabulous stuff. And we all agreed that it could be carnage in a classroom,

40
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,440
or depending on the children, it's actually possible. We discussed the sticks that you

41
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:25,280
could actually make them. I've got some here that I made just out of doweling and put a little

42
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:32,160
pattern on the top and varnished them so that there was a catching area. Softwood. Actually,

43
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,560
a couple of classes I've worked with really love these games. Not nearly as complex as we did

44
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:45,520
there. And shiny, glossy magazines, roll them up, sellotape them. That's another cheaper option.

45
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,160
Then we went on to talk about things we could do with this little chart. Here's our new rhythm

46
00:06:52,160 --> 00:07:00,160
here. And we very quickly moved to this chart here to devise different things, different games.

47
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,480
All of these ideally would be prepared in different songs and repertoire, ideally. But again,

48
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:13,120
it's not a new rhythm, it's just a new context. So from a simplest form, moving all of these,

49
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:20,160
obviously, one beat long, just literally clapping what we saw. That was one thing we did.

50
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:26,480
And then the other thing we did was clapping two at a time, what could they memorise to.

51
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:34,720
And then we divided into two groups. One clapped round this way, and the other clapped round this

52
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,240
way. And then we tried something really challenging. One group clapped this way,

53
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:49,120
or sorry, everybody clapping this way, saying the rhythm names. Sorry, not clapping. Everybody

54
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,280
saying the rhythm names this way to hear, but at the same time clapping the pattern they see on the

55
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,520
other side. We did that very slowly. It was fine here, but when we get to here, it's a bit more

56
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:08,880
challenging. So again, just differentiated learning activities for the children. Singing a song

57
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:16,800
and clapping a different ostinato pattern created from here, or singing a song they know and just

58
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:24,240
clapping, not an ostinato, but literally wherever the leader points. So advanced practice activities,

59
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:31,760
these were all advanced. We looked at clapping this rhythm, top part rhythm, which was really

60
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:37,760
a rhythm, and then the second half just beat. Similarly on the bottom beat, then just rhythm.

61
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,920
Could the children put those two things together? One part with one hand and one part with the

62
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:51,920
other hand. That led then to composition activity, creating over the beat, remembering what groups

63
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:58,320
as a beat. So compound time takes a lot of practice. So this composition obviously would be

64
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:05,920
a much later activity. Then we looked at this activity here and what the challenges might be

65
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:12,400
singing this in two parts. Not too difficult to sing from a pitch perspective because it really

66
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:18,160
moves largely by step. Things that might catch them out just when it doesn't move by step here

67
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:25,280
at the end. But how would we prepare it? And we talked about the possibility of practicing

68
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:31,440
any difficult intervals, although there aren't so many in here, or circling things that might

69
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:39,600
catch them out. But largely maybe singing the top melody, clapping the bottom so that they

70
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:46,960
could do this as a kind of singing clap exercise. And moving on from that, singing in two parts.

71
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:53,520
I did say the quotation that Kodai used, it's not an exact word for word, but something like

72
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:59,600
if the sight singing of children is too difficult that they're wading through it and it's challenging,

73
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,120
then there's no point in the sight singing. That they should feel rhythmically how it goes,

74
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,560
it should be rhythmically fluent. And obviously when children sight sing, there's going to be

75
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:17,040
some errors, but they should largely be rhythmically fluent with what they do. So,

76
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,800
preparing it or giving children sight singing that's maybe slightly lower than their level of

77
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,720
reading ability. Their singing ability is here, but their reading ability is always a bit lower.

78
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,480
Speedbody boat, this is why we did team cat again. Team cat isn't a new rhythm,

79
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,800
they've done the rhythm, it's just a different grouping of that rhythm.

80
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,640
And then we worked a tiny bit on harmony, a compound time melody. We did this as a creative

81
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:57,360
text exercise. So, where it was the Isle of Skye on an apple pie, we changed it. The leader sings

82
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:08,880
maybe to the Isle of Mull. And the children have to come up with honour. And I can't remember what

83
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,480
we came up with, because I can't remember if I used Isle and Mull, but it could be on a skeleton

84
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:22,160
skull and back again by morning. So, we did a bit of creative text around that. And then we looked at

85
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:29,120
this holding the Do as a pedal all the way through, and then explaining what that triad would be.

86
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,080
And if this is chord one based on Do, could the children work out what would be chord five,

87
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:40,240
which is the fifth note, and build the triad there. Then we put the new triad into context

88
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:49,760
in the scale. As a Do, so Do, little accompaniment. Then we added chord four for this

89
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:59,040
beat here. Similarly, the children can work this out. And then we have another baseline part. Or,

90
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:05,760
we could create different parts from the whole triad. This is a very simple baseline using the

91
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,320
root of the triad. But of course, the kids could do something much more interesting.

92
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:24,320
Much more interesting. Going from tonic to dominant. Whatever the chord pattern would be,

93
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,640
they choose their pathway through. So, there's our song with the accompaniment.

94
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,280
Then it became a composition activity. Writing their own accompaniment. There's the rhythm is

95
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:44,240
given, but the children have to choose from the triad. So, they could choose literally just the

96
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,040
root note, but it would be much more interesting if they chose a pathway through. Much more

97
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:56,960
interesting as a class activity. Then we looked at framing some sight singing. So, framing by

98
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,840
singing the first beat of the bar, rather than showing them everything at once, which can be

99
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:10,160
just a bit overwhelming. Gradually taking bits away. Bit more each time. Obviously, we sang all

100
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,720
this through in the class. And then revealing the whole thing. But by the time we've got to here,

101
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,000
they've sung the framework. So, they've got a fair idea of how it goes.

102
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,440
And the last thing we did was look at creating a game for 9-8 and 12-8.

103
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:32,000
Now, we went into breakout rooms. How would we feel 9-8 and 12-8 through a game? Sorry,

104
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,080
just 9-8. Apologies, not 12-8. How would we feel 9-8? We should feel the beat, but we should also

105
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:45,600
feel the subdivision. So, that was a very quick summary of what we did in our lesson. It would

106
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,880
have been much more interesting to see all of your faces and have that recording. Unfortunately,

107
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:57,280
stupid me forgot to press record. There's a bit more here on the PDF. We'll quickly go over that

108
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:02,000
just in the next class, because it's really just how we introduced the children to the idea of

109
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,640
simple and compound time. That will be on the PDF forever, however. So, sorry again for forgetting

110
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:21,360
to record. I hope the summary is in some way helpful, and I'll see you on Friday. All the best. Bye!
